This repository contains a data analytics project I completed for the marketing team of Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company based in Chicago, Illinois, US. This was a capstone pathway in Google's Data Analytics Professional Certification. While working for the company's marketing team, I pull the last 12 months of data into R Studio, conduct an analysis to explore how casual riders differ from annual members, and provide several recommendations for the company to drive conversions of casual riders into annual members.

The repository contains the processed data, all visualizations produced throughout the analysis process, and a technical and nontechnical report written in R Markdown, stitched with YAML, and annotated with a BibTex file. I knitted the final nontechnical report into HTML and the final technical report into two different file types for variable readability (HTML and PDF). 

For those looking to explore the unprocessed data or reproduce the analysis, they can access the raw data files (zipped) by [following this link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and opening the technical R Notebook document `Cyclistic_case_study.Rmd` while ensuring proper file pathways.

For any questions or feedback, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Thank you for your interest in this project.
